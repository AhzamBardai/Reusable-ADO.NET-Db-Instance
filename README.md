# Reusable-ADO.NET-Db-Instance
This is my attempt at making a resusable Db Instance from a sql list Database. Orignal way of doing this was to open a connection each time to run a SQL query and use the reader to read each piece of data coming in. This approach allows you to send a function inside the Reusable Db Instance and read the data back.
